## Description

The **Patty's Teach You with a simple GUI (patty-gui.js)** library is a simple Javascript library designed to assist teachers and students of programming - especially for the Web - to demonstrate the main concepts of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and events using a web browser and Javascript.

If you're tired of creating an HTML page and a CSS file just to make a simple web graphical interface, this is your library. :-D \o/
